The project was created using Eclipse version Oxygen, so it can be imported as a Maven project and run in Eclipset. The code is compiled with Java 8, so a compatible JDK must be added to Eclipse. The source code created by the project is located “src\main\java\cis579\ai”. A lot of other source files were modified, but all the AI logic was contained with that directory.
